# This is the Capture2Text OCR substitutions file.
# This file allows you to substitute one text string for another text string.
#
# This is useful when Capture2Text consistently makes the same mistake
# when OCRing text such as recognizing an "M" as "I\/|".
#
# Just find the appropriate language section and add one substitution
# per line in this format:
#   from_text = to_text
#
# Example (adding 3 substitutions to the English section):
#   English:
#     I\/| = M
#     >< = X
#     some%space%text = some_text
#
# To create a substitution regardless of language, add the substitution to
# the "All:" section.
#
# Special tokens and escape characters:
#   %space% = Space character ( )
#   %tab%   = Tab character (	)
#   %eq%    = Equals (=)
#   %perc%  = Percent sign (%)
#   %lf%    = Linefeed character (\n)
#   %cr%    = Carriage return character (\r)
#
# You may disable a substitution by adding a "#" in front.
#
# When done editing this file, either restart Capture2Text or switch language
# for the substitutions to take effect.
