# Automaton Project
Automaton was a suite of automation scripts designed for the game Wurm Online.

It was never finished, but this repository stands to host the code as it was left, as well as the previous iterations of the project.

Any of the folders will functionally work the same. The images need to be up to date for the corresponding items or GUI elements and they need to be taken with text antialiasing disabled as well as GUI opacity set to 100%. Older, pre-existing images are **not** included. Much of what is in these programs will also work with just a few simple changes to account for UI redesigns and game mechanic changes. Distribution02092020 was written in Autoit taking advantage of a grid layout and simba's image recognition and are super dated, and as a result will not work without significant changes. Gobanned stands as the most recent functional rendition of the scripts.
